## 1️⃣ AttriT: Attribution for Distilled Vision Transformer
* **Overview:** In this work, we introduce AttriT, a knowledge distillation method designed to optimize the training of compact vision transformers for deployment in resource-constrained environments. We use an attribution-based loss term that accounts for the attribution of each image patch’s importance to the final prediction. We hope this additional loss term enhances the alignment between the larger teacher model and the smaller student model, enabling the latter to more effectively mimic the former’s capabilities. Check out the details in our ongoing project [GitHub repository](#).

## 2️⃣ Leveraging Translation For Optimal Recall: Tailoring LLM Personalization With User Profiles
* **Overview:** This paper explores a technique for improving recall in cross-language information retrieval (CLIR) systems using iterative query refinement grounded in the user's lexical-semantic space. The proposed methodology combines multi-level translation, semantic embedding-based expansion, and user profile-centered augmentation to address the challenge of matching variance between user queries and relevant documents. You can review our implementation details in the [#LangChain pull request](#) and dive deeper into our findings in our [arXiv paper](#).

## 3️⃣ Personalized Llama3-based VLM: Dog Robot and Blind Person Assistant
* **Overview:** We are developing a personalized visual-language model (VLM) based on the Llama3 architecture to assist blind individuals with a dog robot. This system combines visual and language inputs to provide meaningful assistance in real-world scenarios, significantly enhancing the independence and quality of life for visually impaired users.
